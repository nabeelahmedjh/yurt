# Running the project locally

For the first timers:
1. Install NodeJS if you do not have it installed.
2. Then open project root `yurt`
3. Run `cd frontend`
4. Do a `ls` and you should be able to see a `package.json` file among other files.
5. Run `npm i`, this will install the required dependencies.

Then everytime you need to run the project, do `npm run dev`
